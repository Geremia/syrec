AnnotatableQuantumComputation
=============================

The following enum defines the possible qubit label types that can be generated for a qubit of the annotatable quantum computation

    .. autoclass:: mqt.syrec.qubit_label_type
        :undoc-members:
        :members:

A class to build a MQT::Core QuantumComputation that also offers functionality to annotate its quantum operations with string key value pairs.

   .. autoclass:: mqt.syrec.annotatable_quantum_computation
        :undoc-members:
